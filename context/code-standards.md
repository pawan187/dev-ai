# Code Standards

## General

- Keep modules small and single-purpose
- Fix root causes, do not layer workarounds
- Do not mix unrelated concerns in one component or route
- Respect the system boundaries defined in architecture-context.md

## TypeScript

- Strict mode is required throughout the project
- Avoid any — use explicit interfaces or narrowly scoped types
- Validate unknown external input at system boundaries before trusting it
- use interface for object contracts.

##  Next.js

- Default to React server components
- Add use client only when the component needs browser interactivity, hooks or realt-time state.
- Keep route handlers focused on a single responsibility
- Long-running work belongs in background tasks, not in requrest handlers.

## Styling

- Use CSS custom property tokens defined in global.css — no raw tailwind color classes like zinc.* or hardcoded hex values
- Reference token throught their tailwind untility names: bg-base, text-copy-primary. border-surface-border, text-band , etc.
- Maintain the border radius scale: rounded-xl for small elements, rounded-2xl for cards, rounded-3xl for modals.

## API Routes

- Validate and parse request input before any logic runs
- Enforce auth and project ownership checks before any mutation
- Return consistent, predictable response shapes
- Keep route handlers thin - push complexity into shared modules or backgrund tasks.

## Data and Storage
- Project metadata and relationships belong in postgreSQL via prisma.
- Canvas snapshots and generated specs belong in Vercel Blob; Prisma stores only the blob URL reference.
- Do not store large content directly in  the database.
- Task run records are first class relational data - treat ownership and run IDs as verified before any token issuance.

## File Organization

- lib/ - shared infrastructure: prisma client, auth helpers, utilities.
- trigger/ - all durable background tasks and al workflows.
- components/ - UI composition only; no bussiness logic.
- app/api - route handlers for auth, triggering and persistence.
- Name files after the responsibi/lity they contain, not the technology.
